	<p>My favorite beverage would have to be coffee! The exclamation point is there because I am drinking a cup of coffee right now! Coffee in the morning, coffee in the afternoon, but not coffee at night, unless I am falling asleep watching a movie or a football game.
Of course, another name for coffee is Java!
